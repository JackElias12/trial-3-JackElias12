        <p>Early Life- Ferguson, Christopher. “Bill Gates- The birth of the computer | Lori Weintrob.” Wagner Faculty Sites, https://faculty.wagner.edu/lori-weintrob/bill-gates-the-birth-of-the-computer/. Accessed 18 September 2024.

            Gates’s childhood is exactly what you would think a multi-billion dollar CEO’s early life would look like. Instead of socializing, Gates preferred reading encyclopedias and playing intricate board games. When he started school at age 13, he aced all of his classes even being exempt from going to mathematics classes as he was deemed too intelligent for it. By 1973, Gates found himself with a 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT and attending Harvard doing general studies including mathematics and entry level computer sciences.
